# Dynamic-Arrayed-Comparison
R code for simulation and real data application parts of the paper "Dynamic Impairment Classification Through Arrayed Comparisons". The real MACS data is not uploaded since it is sensitive. Instead, we provide a simulated data (which is not used by the paper) for reference.

## Real Data Application
Each folder contains codes that generates the results of the cognitive impairment proportion and predicted number of assessments on the MACS data, using one of the three methods that predicts the number of assessments (the two-model approach, CPR and CGPR).

## Simulation
Each folder contains codes that generates the table or figures of the corresponding part of the paper (or the response letter).
